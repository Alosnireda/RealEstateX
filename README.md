# Real Estate Smart Contract on Stacks Blockchain

## Overview

This project provides a robust and feature-rich smart contract for managing real estate transactions on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity. The contract automates the processes of property listing, buying, selling, and dispute resolution, reducing the need for intermediaries and ensuring transparency and security in real estate transactions.

## Features

1. **Property Listing and Metadata:**
   - Register properties as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with unique asset IDs.
   - Include property details like cost and listing duration.

2. **Automated Transactions:**
   - Automate the buying and selling of properties.
   - Use an escrow mechanism to hold funds and transfer ownership once conditions are met.

3. **Multi-Signature Approval:**
   - Require multiple approvers to validate high-value transactions.
   - Ensure security and consensus before completing a property sale.

4. **Dynamic Pricing and Listing Expiration:**
   - Allow property owners to update property prices.
   - Automatically cancel property listings after the expiration period.

5. **Dispute Resolution:**
   - Reset transactions in case of disputes or errors, safeguarding both buyers and sellers.

## Prerequisites

- Stacks Blockchain Network: A Stacks node or access to a network like the Stacks Testnet or Mainnet.
- Clarity Smart Contract Development Tools: Install [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) for local development and testing.
- Familiarity with Clarity Language: Basic knowledge of the Clarity language and the Stacks ecosystem.

## Contract Overview

The smart contract consists of the following key components:

1. **Variables:**
   - `property-owner`: Stores the address of the property owner.
   - `potential-buyer`: Optionally stores the address of a potential buyer.
   - `property-cost`: The cost of the property in microSTX.
   - `transaction-complete`: A boolean flag indicating if the property has been sold.
   - `property-asset-id`: The unique ID representing the property NFT.
   - `listing-expiration`: Expiration time of the property listing in blocks.
   - `multi-signature-approvers`: A list of principals who can approve the transaction.
   - `approvers-count`: The number of approvals received for the transaction.

2. **NFT Definition:**
   - `real-estate-nft`: Represents the property as a non-fungible token.

3. **Core Functions:**
   - `register-property`: Registers a property with a cost, asset ID, and expiration duration.
   - `submit-offer`: Allows a buyer to express interest in the property.
   - `add-approver`: Adds a multi-signature approver for the transaction.
   - `approve-transaction`: Approves the transaction from an approver's side.
   - `complete-transaction`: Finalizes the sale, transferring ownership and funds.
   - `withdraw-offer`: Allows the buyer to withdraw their offer.
   - `update-property-cost`: Updates the cost of the property.
   - `cancel-listing-if-expired`: Cancels the property listing if the expiration time has passed.
   - `reset-transaction`: Resets the transaction in case of disputes.

4. **Events:**
   - `property-listed`: Logs details when a property is listed.
   - `transaction-completed`: Logs details when a transaction is successfully completed.

## Usage

### Listing a Property

```clarity
(register-property cost asset-id duration)
```
- **cost**: The cost of the property in microSTX.
- **asset-id**: The unique ID for the property.
- **duration**: The number of blocks for which the listing is valid.

### Submitting an Offer

```clarity
(submit-offer)
```
- The potential buyer submits an offer for the property.

### Completing the Transaction

```clarity
(complete-transaction)
```
- Finalizes the sale, transferring ownership and funds, provided that the transaction has the necessary approvals.

### Updating Property Cost

```clarity
(update-property-cost new-cost)
```
- **new-cost**: The updated cost of the property in microSTX.

### Cancelling Expired Listings

```clarity
(cancel-listing-if-expired)
```
- Cancels the property listing if the listing has expired.

### Resetting the Transaction

```clarity
(reset-transaction)
```
- Resets the transaction state, allowing a fresh start in case of disputes.
